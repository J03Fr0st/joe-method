# Azure DevOps Reviewer â€“ Future Enhancements

- **Auto triage**: filter PRs by reviewer tags, labels, size; flag high-risk files; surface merge conflicts.
- **Status updates**: push summaries to Teams/email; track review SLA; notify on new comments or updated commits.
- **Review metrics**: gather cycle time, comment density, churn; export dashboards or CSV for analytics.
- **Branch validation hooks**: kick off pipelines/tests directly from the tool; surface results inline; allow reruns.
- **Diff highlighting**: render unified diffs with syntax highlighting; collapse unchanged hunks; support search/filter.
- **Snippet review helpers**: fetch surrounding context, linked work items, commit history; show ownership or CODEOWNERS hints.
- **Bulk actions**: approve multiple threads at once, assign reviewers, set auto-complete options, or transition work items.
- **Offline cache**: store recent PR data locally for quick lookup; enable diff inspection without new API calls.
